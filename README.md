## 🛠️ Customization & Extension

### Adding New Competitions

```sql
INSERT INTO competitions (competition_name, sponsor, season, country) 
VALUES ('La Liga', 'Santander', '2024-25', 'Spain');
```

### Extending Player Attributes

The flexible schema allows easy addition of new player attributes:

```sql
-- Add new columns to players table
ALTER TABLE players 
ADD COLUMN market_value DECIMAL(12,2),
ADD COLUMN social_media_handle VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN agent_name VARCHAR(100);
```

### Custom Views for Specific Needs

```sql
-- Team discipline analysis
CREATE VIEW team_discipline AS
SELECT 
    t.team_name,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN c.card_type = 'Yellow' THEN 1 END) AS yellow_cards,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN c.card_type = 'Red' THEN 1 END) AS red_cards,
    ROUND(COUNT(c.card_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT f.fixture_id), 2) AS cards_per_match
FROM teams t
LEFT JOIN players p ON t.team_id = p.team_id
LEFT JOIN cards c ON p.player_id = c.player_id
LEFT JOIN fixtures f ON c.fixture_id = f.fixture_id
GROUP BY t.team_id, t.team_name;

-- Player value analysis
CREATE VIEW player_market_analysis AS
SELECT 
    CONCAT(p.first_name, ' ', p.last_name) AS player_name,
    t.team_name,
    pos.position_name,
    ps.goals_scored,
    ps.assists,
    pc.weekly_salary * 52 AS annual_salary,
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, p.date_of_birth, CURDATE()) AS age
FROM players p
JOIN teams t ON p.team_id = t.team_id
JOIN positions pos ON p.position_id = pos.position_id
LEFT JOIN player_statistics ps ON p.player_id = ps.player_id
LEFT JOIN player_contracts pc ON p.player_id = pc.player_id AND pc.is_active = TRUE
WHERE ps.season = '2024-25';
```

### Performance Optimization Tips

```sql
-- Add custom indexes for frequently queried columns
CREATE INDEX idx_fixtures_date_status ON fixtures(match_date, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_goals_player_season ON goals(player_id, fixture_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_player_stats_season_goals ON player_statistics(season, goals_scored DESC);

-- Analyze table performance
ANALYZE TABLE fixtures, players, goals, player_statistics;

-- Check query execution plans
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM fixtures WHERE match_date >= CURDATE();
```
